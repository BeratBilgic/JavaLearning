        Abstract Interface or Skeletal Implementation
        To achieve skeletal implementation:

        Step 1: Create an interface.

        Step 2: Create an Abstract class that implement that interface and
        provides the implementation of common methods.

        Step 3: In the subclass, create a private inner class, which extends the Abstract class.
        Now this class can extend and implement any
        interfaces while using the common method by delegating calls to the Abstract class.
